# DHT22_MQ135_ESP8266_With_Web_Hosting
A sensor-based system is developed using an ESP8266 microcontroller to demonstrate the integration of relational model database storage and backend configuration with PHP for IoT applications. The system utilizes PHP to store environmental data such as temperature, humidity, gas level and air quality read by the sensors. The ESP8266 allow users access a live host web interface. Through this interface, users can monitor latest information stored in the database. Upon posting data, the PHP will POST the environmental data to a database and the web will retrieve the data.
